--- [In the making] ---

The streams come in parts, but due to technical problems - much of it lost the screen recording (exceeding RAM on PC because of not restarting web browser for several days). Thus I decided to condense all useful stuff into one shorter vid, while keeping the original streams online.

The idea is simple: after watching a history of RADAR development I decided I could try to build my own SONAR with what I got at home. At first: computer with speakers and microphone. Possibly a second computer connected by WiFi, another, bigger speakers, directional microphone as a cardboard parabolic antenna - sky is the limit.

In the project I focus on 2 aspects:
- Python backend software
- using extensively LLM to code-generation

The goal is to speed-up the process. Actually it gives me a lot of fun, so I also decided to extend the project beyond the minimal scope:
- some more thoughtful code design
- analysis of signal
- physical calculations

The skills proven by the project:
- git
- remote control
- code design
- prompt engineering
- scipy
- TDD
- microservices
- contenerization
- continuous delivery
- and overall ability to deal with very various challenges
