# sonar_pc

****

The idea is simple: after watching a history of RADAR development I decided I could try to build my own SONAR with what I got at home. At first: computer with speakers and microphone. Possibly a second computer connected by WiFi, another (bigger) speakers, directional microphone as a cardboard parabolic antenna, etc. Sky is the limit.

* part 10 - fun with hardware: ...

In early parts of streamings - due to technical problems - much of it lost the screen recording. Thus I decided to condense all useful stuff into one shorter vid, while keeping the original streams online.

**The scope of project focuses on 2 aspects:**
* **Python backend**
* **Extensive use of LLM for code generation**

The goal was to speed-up the process. It did not come out as I expected, the LLM makes my work faster: but not 10-fold, I think it merely doubles the pace. And the project gave me a lot of fun, so I also decided to extend the project beyond the minimal scope:
- some more thoughtful code design
- analysis of signal
- physical calculations

**The skills proven by the project:**
- git
- remote control
- code design
- prompt engineering
- scipy
- prototyping
- TDD
- threading
- microservices
- contenerization
- continuous delivery
- and overall ability to deal with very various challenges
